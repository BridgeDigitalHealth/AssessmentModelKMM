/**
 * An [InputItem] describes a "part" of a [Question] representing a single answer.
 *
 * For example, if a question is "what is your name" then the input items may include "given name" and "family name"
 * where separate text fields are used to allow the participant to enter their first and last name, and the question
 * may also include a list of titles from which to choose.
 *
 * In another example, the input item could be a single cell in a list that shows the possible choices for a question.
 * In essence, this is akin to a single cell in a table view though the actual implementation may differ.
